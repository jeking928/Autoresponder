This mod allows you to send up to 3 preset emails to your customers after their order has finished.

You choose:
How many days after
Email subject and message

Features:
Supports text and html emails
Test mode
Include customer name (various options)
Log sent emails
Subscribed option
Update order status
Time validation
Product Restriction
Location Restriction
Include product details
Include discount coupon

You choose the order status orders must have for the email to send. So if the order has been

Compatibility
=============

This contribution is compatible with Zen Cart v1.5.0 v1.5.1

IMPORTANT:
============
Zen Cart v1.5.0 v1.5.1 Not backwards compatible.


Affects DB
==========
Creates new records in 'configuration_group' and 'configuration' tables.


Install
=======

0. Backup site files and database.

1. Using Admin -> Tools -> Install SQL Patches, run the included Install.sql
   For best results, copy-and-paste the code into the query field and press 'Send'.

2. Upload autoresponder.php to your Zen Cart root directory.
   Upload the "email" folder and the "includes" folder to your Zen Cart root directory.

3. Go to Admin -> Configuration -> Autoresponder+. Ensure Test Mode is on.

4. Learn how the mod functions. (See How it Works section). Personalise settings.

5. Test the mod to confirm it works how you expect. (See Testing section)

6. Set up a daily cron job. (See Cron section)


How it Works
============

Autoresponder+ is run whenever autoresponder.php is loaded in a web browser. This file queries the database 
and sends out the emails.

Only *exact* matches work. If you define a follow up email for pending 6 days, when you run autoresponder+ no one who has been 
pending for more than 6 days will get the email. The same applies for less than 6 days.
Therefore you should run the file EVERY day, ONCE a day.

If you run the file more than this, customers will receive repeat emails. (See Time Validation setting)
If you run the file less than this, some emails may be missed.

It is ***STRONGLY*** recommended that you rename autoresponder.php to something very hard to guess.

*Whenever* the file is run, "Autoresponder successfully loaded. End of message." will be displayed. This is more 
a confirmation that there are no PHP syntax errors, as the message is output at the very base of the file.



******************************* The configuration settings explained *******************************

<<Enable Autoresponder+>>
Self Explanatory

<<Enable Preset>>
3 emails are currently supported. Choose which ones you want enabled.

<<Mode>>
In test mode, all emails will be sent to the store owner. You will see the customer's name inside the email (if configured).
The customer won't receive anything at all. When in live mode, the mod is running normally.

<<Query>>
Originally this contribution only sent post-order emails. A new query feature has now been added.
One query called 'account-no-order' allows you to send out emails to customers who have created an account but have never created an order.
You could use this to send them a tempting discount coupon or even gain some valuable feedback.
Another possible query is the standard 'account' query. This sends emails to customers who have simply created an account, regardless of whether
they have ever created an order or not.

<<Order Status ID>>
Emails will only send for orders with the defined status. 3 is normal because that's the 'Delivered' status.
You can change the status to anything you like.
If using Google Checkout, you will likely need to add additional statuses. You can do this by separating each status with a comma.
For example: 3, 102, 104
When using the 'account' query, this field is ignored.

<<Post Order Status ID>>
Entering an order status ID here will configure the mod to update the order's status ID with that of the setting once the mod has finished.
This is useful for record keeping, as you can easily check on the Zen Cart orders page whether Autoresponder+ executed for a particular order.
The order status will only be updated if:
a) an email is actually triggered.
b) the ID is different to the ID to trigger
When using the 'account' query, this field is ignored.

<<Days After>>
When you update an order in the order admin area to 3, or whatever you have defined, it is the 'days after' this date.
For example, if an order was dispatched on the 7th July 2008 and today is the 12th July 2008, 5 days would trigger this.
When using the 'account' query, it is the days after the account was created.

<<Subscribed>>
If true, only customers who have selected to receive the newsletter will receive the email.
If false, it is irrelevant whether the customer has selected to receive the newsletter.

<<Restrict Location>>
A new feature whereby emails are only sent to customers residing in the specified location, whether it be zone or country.
It is also possible to exclude a particular location.

For example, you may want to send a slightly diferent email depending on the country the customer is from. You might localise 
the spelling, say an extra thank you if they order from abroad, provide a different discount coupon, or even write in their own language.
You may only want to send emails out to those living in the same zone or country as you.

Scenario: You are based in the UK and deliver to the UK. You also deliver to the US, Canada, Ireland, and Europe.
You want to send an email to those ordering from the UK, but a slightly different email to everywhere else.
To do this, setup Preset #1 to restrict 'to country' and then enter 'United Kingdom'.
For Preset #2, type in the email for everywhere else and select this to restrict 'from country' and enter 'United Kingdom'.

<<Location to Restrict>>
Enter the location you want emails restricted to/from. These should be the locations as selectable on your site's sign-up form.
e.g. Grampian, Ireland, Utah, United Kingdom, Devon, Mexico etc
The customer's address used for restriction is their 'default' address, so not always the address the order is shipped to.

<<Subject>>
Self Explanatory

<<Include Customer Name>>
Option to display the customer's name at the beginning of the email. Choose '0' to not display their name. In terms of formatting,
there will be a paragraph break after their name and before the main message.

<<Include Product Details>>
Option to include in the email details of the items ordered.
Details include the name and quantity of each item ordered. For more information, see the example messages at the bottom of this file.
When using the 'account' query, this field is ignored.

<<Product Details as Links>>
A feature to make the product information in emails clickable. Useful for providing direct links for product review requests.

<<Restrict Product>>
You can set it so that an order related email will only send if the order contains at least one of the defined product IDs.
Only one of the product IDs need to match.
You can identify a product's ID by going to Admin -> Catalog -> Categories/Products and looking up the product.
When using the 'account' query, this field is ignored.
Example entries:
87
9, 40
61, 155, 93, 320

<<Include Discount Coupon>>
This is a feature to include an autogenerated, unique discount coupon in the email. Customers can now receive their very own coupon following each order.
If this feature is configured, the autoresponder+ mod, when executed, will create a new coupon and insert it into the database.
The coupon start date will be the day that the email is sent and the expiry date will be one year after. You can change this to suit your preferences.
For example, you could configure expiry to be just 2 weeks to try to force an immediate sale.
Search for "+1 year" in autoresponder.php. You could change it to "+2 week" or "+6 month". There will be 3 instances.
To use this feature, first you will need to create a discount coupon as normal in the Zen Cart admin panel.
Admin -> Gift Certificate/Coupons -> Coupon Admin
Autoresponder+ when executed will look at this coupon and replicate its settings for the autogenerated coupons.
You should never use this default coupon or delete it. Be sure to enter the coupon name and description.
The code field is unimportant. Autoresponder+ will generate its own random code.
Once you have created the default coupon, paste its coupon code into autoresponder+.
Then in the email message, simply type anywhere the phrase: [coupon]
This phrase will be replaced in the email by the new, autogenerated coupon code.

<<Pre Text Message>>
Enter the message for text emails which you want displayed *before* the product details are shown.
In terms of formatting, there will be a paragraph break after this message and before the product details.
If not including product details, simply enter the whole message here.
Any html used here will be ignored. Hitting the Enter key will start a new paragraph. To insert a link,
simply insert the URL as http://www.zen-cart.com/

<<Post Text Message>>
Enter the message for text emails which you want displayed *after* the product details are shown.
In terms of formatting, there will be a paragraph break after the product details and before this message.
If not including product details, you will need to delete the "Enter email here.." text so it is blank.
Any html used here will be ignored. Hitting the Enter key will start a new paragraph. To insert a link,
simply insert the URL as http://www.zen-cart.com/

<<Pre HTML Message>>
Enter the message for html emails which you want displayed *before* the product details are shown.
In terms of formatting, there will be a paragraph break after this message and before the product details.
If not including product details, simply enter the whole message here.
Hitting the Enter key will be ignored. HTML must be used, e.g. <p /> or <br />.
The html email will contain your usual header logo at the top, and the usual spam-disclaimer message at the base.
To insert a link, use <a href="http://www.zen-cart.com/">Text to be displayed</a>

<<Post HTML Message>>
Enter the message for html emails which you want displayed *after* the product details are shown.
In terms of formatting, there will be a paragraph break after the product details and before this message.
If not including product details, you will need to delete the "Enter email here.." text so it is blank.
Hitting the Enter key will be ignored. HTML must be used, e.g. <p /> or <br />.
The html email will contain your usual header logo at the top, and the usual spam-disclaimer message at the base.
To insert a link, use <a href="http://www.zen-cart.com/">Text to be displayed</a>

Note: As a minimum, you should fill in *both* the Pre Text Message and Pre HTML Message.

<<Time Validation>>
When set to true, autoresponder+ (when loaded) gets the current time and checks to see if this time is between the defined Start Time and End Time.
If it is, autoresponder+ will run normally. If it isn't, autoresponder+ will not run.
Such validation prevents both accidental and malicious loading.
For example, you set the cron job to load the file at 12.35pm each day.

<<Start Time>>
Using the example above, you should enter something like 12:34:00

<<End Time>>
Using the example above, you should enter something like 12:36:00

<<Log Emails>>
When enabled, a text file is created which lists every time autoresponder.php queries the database. (Autoresponder must be 'Enabled' and 
at least one preset must be enabled to log). The log is added to each time. The log also lists details of every email sent (excluding admin copies).
You can delete the log now and again if it gets too large.

<<Log Directory>>
Directory where log is stored. Make sure the directory exists and is writeable. Example /var/www/html/temp/

<<Admin Copy>>
When enabled, store owner receives a copy of the email. The email is the same as the email you would have received if in test mode.
Copies are only sent when in live mode.

<<Admin Email Address>>
You can change the email address where test emails are sent and where copies are sent when in live mode.
If left blank, the default store owner email address is used.
You should use this to test out different email addresses before going live.


To translate or change any of the greetings e.g. "Hello", "Dear" etc, simply edit the following file:
includes/languages/english/extra_definitions/autoresponder.php

*******************************************************************************************************


Testing
=======

*It is highly recommended that you test the mod before using it properly*

First ensure Test Mode is on.

Then enable the mod.

Then go and lookup when your last order was *completed* (or last account was created)

Set the 'Days After' so that it triggers.

Then in your web browser, navigate to http://www.your_domain.com/autoresponder.php

You should then receive the email(s).

IMPORTANT: If using the "Post Order Status ID" setting, you should be aware that this works while in test mode!
If you want to safely test this feature, you should create and use a test order instead.

If you want to test out different email addresses, simply change the 'Admin Email Address' field in Autoresponder+ admin.

(Changing this also alters the email address for where admin copies are sent in live mode)


Cron
====

You need to set up a cron job to run autoresponder.php *** ONCE a day, EVERY day ***

A cron job is a time-based task that your server is able to execute.

You may have easy access to do this (e.g. cPanel), or you may have to ask your host to give you access to some other programme or console.

Either way, your host can help you.

My host configured the cron job for me (thanks TerraNetwork) so I have no real information here.

Please don't populate the mod's support thread with cron job questions. This falls under your host's responsibility.


	An alternative to cron
	----------------------

	Do you have a web browser which you rarely use? If not, download one. Firefox, Opera, Chrome etc

	Set the browser's homepage to point at the file. (File should be in root)

	Set your operating system to schedule a daily task to open the browser at a time when your computer is often on.


	Another alternative to cron
	---------------------------

	Use a service like WebCron.org
