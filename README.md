# Autoresponder

This mod allows you to send a preset email to your customers after their order has finished.

You choose:
How many days after
Email subject and message

Features:
Supports text and html emails
Test mode
Enable/disable setting
Receive admin copy
Include customer name (various options)
Log sent emails

You choose the order status orders must have for the email to send. So if the order has been refunded or has not yet completed, customers are not bothered by an irrelevant email.

Requires a daily cron job to be scheduled.
